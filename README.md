## Welcome to ReflexCMS [![Project Status](http://stillmaintained.com/Jamesking56/ReflexCMS.png)](http://stillmaintained.com/Jamesking56/ReflexCMS)
Welcome to the ReflexCMS project! This project will change the quality of Habbo retro CMS systems forever!

ReflexCMS is built to run with **ANY** Habbo based emulator!

How does this work? Well, for a habbo emulator to work with this system, the owners of that emulator (with the help of me possibly) must create a PHP class file to tell ReflexCMS how it should handle to make it work with that emulator.

The `.emu.php` file denotes all actions for ReflexCMS which is crafted for each emulator making ReflexCMS work with that emulator.

----
Here are some other Planned Features:

+ **Easy Installation via an Installer**
+ **Object Oriented development to keep your retro fast**
+ **Easy templating via Smarty**
+ **Interchangeable Templates** (aka. "Themes") **to change the looks of your retro.** (Uses Twitter Bootstrap as default)
+ **Supports multiple languages!** (Looking for Translators soon!)
+ **Can work with virtually any emulator!** (by providing and emu.php file)
+ **Interchangeable client** (Change Habbo version with ease!)
+ **Supports multiple Database engines including Flat File &amp; MySQL!**
+ **Easy to upgrade to newer versions!**
+ **Notified when ReflexCMS has an update available!**
+ **Possible Windows & Mac Desktop app coming soon to notify you of new Call for help requests!** (In planning)
+ **FREE and OPEN SOURCE to use Non-Comercially!** (Must pay James if you're making money using this system! - See Licensing below)
+ **Easy Migration from other systems!** (Move your retro to ReflexCMS!)
+ **Great GitHub based help here via the [Issues](https://github.com/Jamesking56/ReflexCMS/issues) page and [Wiki](https://github.com/Jamesking56/ReflexCMS/wiki)!**

You can request new features by submitting an [Issue](https://github.com/Jamesking56/ReflexCMS/issues/new).

Here's how you can help:

## So, what do we do now?
At the moment, there isn't a release of ReflexCMS available for you to download. You can however download the "In Development" version (which is not assigned a version number) which gives you a snapshot of the CMS in current development. We recommend that you only download and use this if the build status is passing as shown below:

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Jamesking56/ReflexCMS.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Jamesking56/ReflexCMS)

To download versioned copies (ones that are assigned a version number and have been thoroughly tested) you will have to wait until we complete v0.1a.
